<h3>The Websites that I like</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.prevention.com/workouts/">Prevention.com </a>- I like this Website because is different. They use a lot of pictures to bring the public or user attention.
  The images on website explain everything the user or client need to know about their service or product.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs?&trk=li_sem_namer_careers_jobsgtm_Careers_NAMER_T1_USCA_Search_Google-Brand_DR-PRS_Multiple_Brand-LinkedIn-Jobs-Exact_Desktop_English_Core_network=g_campaign=11602008719_keyword=linkedin%20jobs&src=go-pa&veh=&mcid=&cname=Careers_NAMER_T1_USCA_Search_Google-Brand_DR-PRS_Multiple_Brand-LinkedIn-Jobs-Exact_Desktop_English_Core&camid=11602008719&asid=113158397036&keyword=linkedin%20jobs&targetid=kwd-1528692947&crid=479259659412&placement=&dev=c&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIl-G5h6ay7gIVgoyGCh1megRdEAAYASAAEgIIL_D_BwE">Linkedin</a> - I like how they engaged everything that is included in website righ on the tope of the page.
    It makes easy to find the page the user want if everything is displayed on the top. The images are very simple and self explainatory.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ebay.com/">Ebay</a>- Like like this website because is very diverse and well organized. It could be confusing sometimes because of amount of images, but the images are posted in the right location and easy to understand.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Websites that I do not like</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://branda-bee-fitness.myshopify.com/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2YTTk7Gy7gIVgsqGCh3uSg7qEAAYAyAAEgKJlPD_BwE">Branda Bee Fitness</a>- I do not like this website because it need more more media. Working out websites need to include more videos and pictures to attract more users.</li>
<li><a href="https://seawallalife.com/free-movie-streaming-sites/">Sea Wall a Life</a>- I do not like this website because the first page is suposed to be loaded with media. The intertainment websites needs to be more artistic with different color of imagens and video</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crescentbeachgrill.com/contact">Crescentbeachgrill</a>- The front page of this website look like a furniture store rather than a grill restaurant and beach that is why I do not like it. They need to include more media in front page like food and people etc.</li>
